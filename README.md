# Analytics-I-BC2406


#How to use:

1. Make sure to download ALL raw datasets (Found in Datasets Raw folder)
2. Remember to set your working directory to the appropriate folder
3. Raw datasets to be used on GDP Dataset Cleaning.R & Political Stability Data Cleaning.R (Found in R code folder)
4. Make sure to download ALL cleaned datasets
5. Set your working directory to appropriate folder
6. Import respective CLEANED datasets for regression analysis (Found in Datasets Cleaned Folder)
7. Cleaned datasets can be used for Political Stability (FSI) Linear Regression and CART.R and GDP Per Capita Linear Regression and CART.R (Found in R code folder)
8. For Sentiment Analysis, remember to download ALL text files and make sure they are in a separate folder with no other files. (Found in R code folder)
9. Remember to download ALL txt files from github. (Found in Sentiment Analysis Folder inside Datasets Cleaned Folder)
10. NOTE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: EACH LINE OF CODE SHOULD ONLY BE RAN ONCE. 
11. If you have to rerun rplot CART/ sample.split remember to run set.seed(2004) first, if not you will get different results.
12. Basically, SET SEED before every random train-test split/rplot CART split.


TODO LIST:
1. Check through code, make sure comments have no error (eg type wrongly cause there's alot of copy pasting: when suppose to type developed become type developing countries
2. Can anyone help to do a confusion matrix DIAGRAM using ggplot?
3. Help add code for summary statistics and more graph. 
4. Add in evaluation whenever necessary and possible.
5. How to get back original value after log transformation? (trainset value) Anyone knows the code?
